# BCS network
This crate contains all the necessary networking components for the BCS to operate.

`BCS v0.1.0-pilot` was released before this package was created, so you shouldn't use this until the next release.

The main purpose for this crate is to pull as many dependecies out of `brewdrivers` as possible. Right now, the debug binary sits at 107 MB, which is too damn high.
