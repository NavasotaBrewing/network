//! This module is replacing what is currently known as Configuration
//!
//! The `Model` struct is a model of the physical layout of the BCS. It contains some metadata,
//! a list of RTUs, and a list of Devices for each RTU. It is designed to be passed back and
//! forth between `brewkit` (VueJS front end) and this crate, the networking crate.
//!
//! This module is responsible for accepting the Model and calling `brewdrivers` to make the
//! necessary device state changes. It's really important.
//!


// The main bits are rtu.rs, device.rs, and model.rs. In this file are just helpers and general
// structs that don't fit anywhere else
